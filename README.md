# autoencoder-colorizer
<h5? A B/W image colorizer made using a residual connection powered autoencoder architecture </h5>

-----------------------------------------
### Motivation, Challenge & Accomplishment

* **Motivation:** Practically applying the theoretical concepts of Convolutional Neural Networks learnt during my internships, studies and from the Convolutional Neural Networks 
course on Coursera to an actual use case based project

* **Challenge:** Finalzing an architecture and the hyperparameters for the neural network that obtains the best colored images

* **Accomplishment:** Deployed the model on Streamlit and despite limited computing resources for training the model, gives decent results

***

### Tech Stack

* Python 3
* Pytorch
* matplotlib
* streamlit
